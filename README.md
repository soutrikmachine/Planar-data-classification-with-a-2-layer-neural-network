# Planar-data-classification-with-a-2-layer-neural-network
In this project we generate red and blue points to form a flower. We then fit a neural network to correctly classify the points. Then we'll try different layers and see the results.
We develope the following:
Develop an intuition of back-propagation and see it work on data.
Recognize that the more hidden layers you have the more complex structure you could capture.
Build all the helper functions to implement a full model with one hidden layer.
